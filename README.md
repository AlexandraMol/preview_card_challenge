## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand CSS properties better. Also, it was a good opportunity for me to exercise on building the Mobile Version of a component.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with understanding how flexbox works. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
